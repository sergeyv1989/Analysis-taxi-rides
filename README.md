# Taxi rides analysis

In this project I will analyze taxi rides for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago.

The data is composed of 4 tables, with information on the rides, the cabs, the neighborhoods and the weather conditions. These are parsed from the web and collected via SQL queries.

The main goal is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. In particular, after collecting the data and some exploratory data analysis, I test the hypothesis that the duration of rides from the the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Sundays.
